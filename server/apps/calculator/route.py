# This file defines the API routes (or "endpoints") specifically for the calculator functionality.
# Using a dedicated router helps to keep the codebase organized and modular. Instead of
# defining all routes in the main `main.py` file, we can group related routes here.

# `APIRouter` is a class from FastAPI that allows you to create a "mini" FastAPI application.
# You can define routes on it, and then include this router in your main `app` instance.
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from schema import ImagePayload # Import the Pydantic model for our request body.
from .utils import analyze # Correctly import the 'analyze' function.

# Create an instance of APIRouter. This `router` object is what we'll use to
# define all the routes for this module.
router = APIRouter()

# --- Path Operation Decorator ---
# This decorator registers the function below it as an API endpoint.
# - `@router.post("/")`: This means this endpoint will respond to HTTP POST requests.
#   The path is `/`. However, because we included this router in `main.py` with a
#   `prefix="/calculate"`, the full URL for this endpoint will be `/calculate/`.
#
# - `response_model=dict`: This tells FastAPI what the shape of the response will be.
#   While we are returning a dictionary here, you could also use a Pydantic model
#   from `schema.py` for stronger validation and better documentation.
@router.post("/", response_model=list)
